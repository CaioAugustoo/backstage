'@backstage/plugin-scaffolder-react': patch
---

The `value` sent on the `create` analytics event (fired when a Scaffolder template is executed) is now set to the number of minutes saved by executing the template. This value is derived from the `backstage.io/time-saved` annotation on the template entity.
